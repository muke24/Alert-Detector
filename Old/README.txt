There is some old versions of this project using different parts.

I got this working on a LILYGO T-SIM7000G and a Viewe ESP32C3 Round knob display (no touch). Everything worked with REAL data, and videos of it working can be found with this Google drive link:

The idea was to have it working with LTE alongside WI-FI, but I learnt that every SIM carrier would need to be coded specifically for it to work, so I gave up on that idea after too much time not even getting my own carrier to work.

The first ever version was actually inside of a Unity Project which I was just messing around with to add it to my Android headunit of my Civic, and this project started the second I saw it working in Unity.
