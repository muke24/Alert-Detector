The "13" model is the one seen in the pictures on the GitHub.

The bottom tray was added in 14 & 15 as I was assuming I was going to wire everything together and put the wires inside the bottom tray, but it's cheaper and easier if a PCB is made, so I hired a freelancer to do it. They weren't able to complete within budget as there were some issues that were needed to be fixed.

Also, "14" and "15" have the GPS holder, which will need to be added to "13". Either modify "13" to have the GPS holder, or remove the tray on "15".

Specifically,
JLCPCB didn't have stock of the motor controller, and PCBWay replied saying there was an issue:

"In your gerber files, some pads clearance in copper layer is smaller than 0.22mm,
therefore, solder mask bridge is not available. If you need black solder mask in these areas
as the attached pic1 showed, pls enlarge space to 0.22mm or there will be no solder mask
between those pads, which may cause short circuit. Pls check and advise".
